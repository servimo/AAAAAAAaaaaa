An EasyEffects preset for my Earbuds

To Install:

1- Move "AAAAAAAaaaaa.json" file to:

<code>~/.config/easyeffects/output</code>

or
<code>~/.var/app/com.github.wwmm.EasyEffects/config/easyeffects/output</code>
depending on how you installed EasyEffects (flatpak).


2- Drop "Accudio ((48kHz Z.E.)) Earpods HIFI.irs" file here :

The convolver must be loaded manually, convolver will show an error loading file.
The convolver impulse is from https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/irs-zhuhangs-irs-impulse-response-samples.2442933/ "Golden Ears Accudio (Z-Edition) - Headphone Correction & Simulations"

I was playing with another preset converted from PulseEffects, which cant remember who did it, using my bluetooth earbuds, then I decided to make this equalizer set with High Shelf type equalization. The others parameters for the others plugins are almost the default ones.   

* The name is for keeping this preset at the top of the alphabetical order.
