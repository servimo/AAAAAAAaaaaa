An EasyEffects preset for my Earbuds

- Limiter
- Convolver
- Equalizer (15 bands, High Shelf)
- Bass Enhancer
- Compressor
- Crossfeed

The convolver must be loaded manually, convolver will show an error loading file.
The convolver impulse is from https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/irs-zhuhangs-irs-impulse-response-samples.2442933/ "Golden Ears Accudio (Z-Edition) - Headphone Correction & Simulations"

I was playing with another preset converted from PulseEffects, which cant remember who did it, using my bluetooth earbuds, then I decided to make this equalizer set using High Shelf. The others parameters for the others plugins are almost the default ones.   

* The name is for keeping this preset at the top of the alphabetical order.
