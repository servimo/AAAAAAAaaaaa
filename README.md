I was playing with another preset converted from PulseEffects, which cant remember who did it, using my bluetooth earbuds, then I decided to make this equalizer set with High Shelf type equalization. The others parameters for the others plugins are almost the default ones.   

* The name is for keeping this preset at the top of the alphabetical order.
