An EasyEffects preset for my Earbuds

- Limiter
- Convolver
- Equalizer (15 bands, High Shelf)
- Bass Enhancer
- Compressor
- Crossfeed

The convolver must be loaded manually.

I was playing with another preset converted from PulseEffects, which cant remember who did it, using my bluetooth earbuds, then I decided to make this equalizer set using High Shelf. The others parameters for the others plugins are almost the default ones.   

* The name is for keeping this preset at the top of the alphabetical order.
